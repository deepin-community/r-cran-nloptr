This is the Debian GNU/Linux r-cran-ecodist package of nlopt.  The
nlopt package provides an interface for R to the NLopt library,
and was written by Jelmer Ypma.

This package was created by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>.
The sources were downloaded from the main CRAN site
	http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/
and are also available from all CRAN mirrors as e.g.
	http://cran.us.r-project.org/src/contrib/

The package was renamed from its upstream name 'nloptr' to
'r-cran-nloptr' to fit the pattern of CRAN (and non-CRAN) packages
for R.

  Description: 
      nloptr is an R interface to NLopt. NLopt is a free/open-source library for 
      nonlinear optimization, providing a common interface for a number of 
      different free optimization routines available online as well as original 
      implementations of various other algorithms.
      See http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/NLopt_Introduction for more 
      information on the available algorithms. During installation on Unix the 
      NLopt code is downloaded and compiled from the NLopt website.
